/*
    1. separate callbacks for success and err.

    What happens if both will be invoked. More trust issues.

    2. Node style error first style. 
    
    One callback but the first param in the callback is error signal. Its always if else inside. 
    But the problem remains the same as in callbacks.

    3. Nested callbacks

    Sequential calling
